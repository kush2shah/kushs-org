# Hey there, welcome to my website code!

I learned how to build a lot of this with help from UNC's COMP 423, Stack Overflow, GenAI, and tutorials on the internet.
I didn't use any templates, so there's no other website out there like this one.

This website runs using a FAST API backend and React Frontend built in TypeScript and SASS.
It was intended to just be a photography portfolio, but now its existence also serves as a programming portfolio.
As always, a work in progress. Feel free to fork it and change it however you like. It's licensed under an MIT License.
