# kushs.org

This website is a portfolio built with React.js and TypeScript. It features dark and light mode toggling and provides the ability to display camera metadata with every photo.

## Project Setup

### Dependencies

- Node.js and npm: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, and npm is the package manager for Node.js packages. You can download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

- Create-React-App: A toolchain for setting up React.js projects without any build configuration. It's used with TypeScript for this project.

### Project setup

1. First, I installed Node.js and npm from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/).

2. Then, I created a new project with `create-react-app` and TypeScript by running:

```bash
npx create-react-app kushs --template typescript
```

This command created a new directory named "kushs" with a basic React.js project setup with TypeScript.
